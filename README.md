## About

Analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends in Cairo (closest city to where I live) to overall global temperature trend:
-	Extracted data from a database using a SQL query.
-	Calculated the moving average.
-	Created a visualization that compared Cairoâ€™s temperatures with the global temperatures.
-	Prepared a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in Cairo, in addition to observations on the overall trend look.
